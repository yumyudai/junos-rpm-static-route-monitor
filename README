# Static Route Tracking based on RPM Monitor for Junos EVO

As of 2023/08/07, Junos EVO does not support static route tracking based on RPM probes.
This script is to achieve similar feature via JET script.

Use at your own risk!

How To Use:
1. Upload JET script to the router
$ scp rpm-monitor.py evouser@192.168.0.1:/var/db/scripts/jet/

2. Enable JET script
> show configuration system extensions | display set
set system extensions extension-service application file rpm-monitor.py daemonize
set system extensions extension-service application file rpm-monitor.py respawn-on-normal-exit
set system extensions extension-service application file rpm-monitor.py username jcluser

3. Configure static route and RPM probe
> show configuration services | display set
set services monitoring rpm owner ipv6-target test 2001::2 apply-macro disable-static-on-fail
set services monitoring rpm owner ipv6-target test 2001::2 probe-type icmp-ping
set services monitoring rpm owner ipv6-target test 2001::2 offload-type none
set services monitoring rpm owner ipv6-target test 2001::2 target 2001::2
set services monitoring rpm owner ipv6-target test 2001::2 probe-count 1
set services monitoring rpm owner ipv6-target test 2001::2 probe-interval 1
set services monitoring rpm owner ipv6-target test 2001::2 test-interval 3
set services monitoring rpm owner ipv6-target test 2001::2 thresholds successive-loss 3

> show configuration routing-options | display set
set routing-options rib inet6.0 static route 2001:db8:2::/64 next-hop 2001::2


This script checks for "apply-macro disable-static-on-fail" flag under test configuration.
If you do not set this flag, the script would not deactivate the static route even if there is a next-hop route which is same as the target address.


How to Debug:
1. Check if RPM is failing or passing
> show services monitoring rpm probe-results status PASS
> show services monitoring rpm probe-results status FAIL

2. Enable Debug Log
set system syslog file debug any verbose
set system syslog file debug match rpm-monitor

3. Check if there is any errors
show log debug
show log messages
